            Unique, relevant, and impactful content is an important element of
            the marketing mix for high-tech B2B companies. It creates awareness,
            builds credibility, and helps differentiate the organization within
            the marketplace.

        <p>
          Unfortunately, domain experts within the organization (CEO, CTO,
          developers) oftentimes do not have the time to commit to creating
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, marketing teams may not have the technical expertise
          required to understand and uplevel the content for clarity to a wider
          audience (or they simply donâ€™t have the time to create the content
          themselves).
